# restacf
An Archimedes code factory for REST servers.

## Notes
It's a bee project. So you have to install a JDK (8+) with "jar" and "javac" to build the project via bee. Note that the bee.sh script must be eventually changed by setting or removing the JAVA_HOME definition in the first script line.
